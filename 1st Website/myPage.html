	<p>Hi I'm weston the creator of this site and this is a picture of my favorite hockey player.<br/>
	In this site you will learn some of the basics to building your own website using HTML.
	<hr/>
	<h2>Tags</h2>
	<p>  The language of HTML revolves around tags. Every component in a website is <br/>
	contained within a tag. The first tag you create on a website declares the doctype, <br/>
	or the type of file your document will be.  <br/><br/> 
	<span>&lt;p&gt;</span> : This is the paragraph tag. Whenever you want to have writing in your website<br/>
	you put this before the paragraph and then you put this at the end of the paragraph: <span>&lt;/p&gt;</span><br/><br/>
	<span>&lt;br/&gt;</span> : This is the line break tag.  HTML can't read line breaks by itself so whenever you want a <br/>
	line break to be put somewhere you have to put this tag.  
	Here is some tags in an unordered list:
	<ul>
		<li>br</li>
		<li>p</li>
		<li>hr</li>
		<li>li</li>
		
	</ul>
	Here is an ordered list of my top 3 favorite tags:
	<ol>
		<li>p</li>
		<li>br</li>
		<li>hr</li>
		
	</ol>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Links</h2>
	<p>No website in complete without having some links to other websites.  In order to add links to your website you use <br/>
	the href tag.  The format used in HTML for using links looks like this: &lt;a href = "link goes in quotations"&gt; what you want the link to say &lt;/a&gt;.</p>
	<hr/>
	<h2>Adding Images</h2>
	<p>The last thing I will teach you about is adding images to your website.  To add an image all you have to do is <br/>
	find an image online, download it, and then give it a cool file name.  Then you have to use this when coding in HTML to <br/>
	add the image: &lt;img src = "file name of image" &gt;.
	If you want to learn more about making websites from the coolest 
	teacher ever, Mr. Robinnette, </p>
